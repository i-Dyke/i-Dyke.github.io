title: Hello from Ian, and Welcome!

I'm working to bring humanoids into the real world ðŸ¦¾! Mechanical Engineer by trade, coder by necessity, and roboticist by interest. 

I'm deeply impassioned by the open-source mindset, and always working to...

Some of the robotics projects I've had the fortune to lead:

- [[K-Scale KBot]], Open-source Full-size Humanoid
- [[K-Scale ZBot]], the Everyday Mini Humanoid
- [[MOHRA]], the DIY senior project robot

And my current projects, WIP:

- [[gearage]], an in-depth toolkit and explainer on Gear Geometry
