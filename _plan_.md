# Layout

* Intro page directory --> 
    * Project Portfolio :: MAIN THING
    * Side links at the top for:
        * Github page
        * Current Resume
        * About Me
        * Certifications



* Project Portfolio
    * Premise: have a flowing webpage for the basic summaries, then clickables for each of the components to go more in-depth

    * Features:
        * Summaries for each of the projects -- clickable to direct to a more flushed out description (ppsx for now?)
            * 1/2 pictures collaged to the side
            * Description, involved work, outcomes ~ quickly
        
        * Ideally, would have some way of sorting it to align with the interest by the reader
            * Seperate links from the index page for each? ~ straightforwards but rather manual
                * Some way to automate the contents being taken to each of the directed webpages?
            * some sort of filtering script within the page itself
                * basically database sort option, importing webpages to the main page but sorted by the defined criteria    

    * Content:
        * (all the stuff from PPTX)
        * Gear Maker
        * Titanium Shafts
        * More Malawi team stuff?
